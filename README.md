## Description

Secure passwords are crucial to ensuring the privacy of one's information! Individuals and companies alike can use this web application to create random passwords that suit their preference.

The goal for this website is to collect user input through prompts and confirms, and output a password based on the user's specification. Javascript is used to query the user and construct the password. Using DOM manipulation, the resulting password is displayed on screen.
